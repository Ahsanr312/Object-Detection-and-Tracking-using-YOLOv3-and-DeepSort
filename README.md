# Object-Detection-and-Tracking-using-YOLOv3-and-DeepSORT
This repository implements object detection and tracking using state-of-the-art algorithms, that are, YOLOv3 and DeepSORT. All the computation required will be performed using Google Colab. Mainly, the process will involve two main steps: 
#### First: Training an Object Detector (YOLOv3) to detect target object
#### Second: Apply Tracker (DeepSORT) to trained YOLOv3 weights to perform tracking
